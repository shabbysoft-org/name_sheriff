# name_sheriff
Discord bot that allows you to rename other people in the server. Made with Python3.

`pip3 install discord` should be all you need

Run the bot and set the role to the highest it can possibly go in your server. If a user has "higher" permissions than the bot, it won't be able to rename them. Bot can't rename server owners.
